[11/06, 06:42] Sikhanyiso: I suggest we increase line coverage for the activities we can test without problems to 80%-90% and delete any unnecessary activity that we might have. I think there is a way to ignore a whole file but not certain lines, ill look it up if iget it  code cov will ignore all the helper files that you wrote  and that will help increase our coverage... then  we must nonetheless test those activities with problems and keep those tests in our machines just incase whoever will be marking us realises that certain activities are not tested at all we can explain n the person running the emulator run those tests locally.
