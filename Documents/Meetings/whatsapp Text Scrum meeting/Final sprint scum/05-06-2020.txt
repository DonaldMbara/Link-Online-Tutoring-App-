[05/06, 00:00] Emmanuel_:  so more work
[05/06, 00:01] MJ: Not too much though 
[05/06, 00:01] Emmanuel_: Guys how do we discriminate between tutor and tutee
[05/06, 00:03] MJ: For that we agreed to let users specify during registration, but we haven’t discussed what features are exclusive for tutors and stuff like that, that would be complicated
[05/06, 09:10] Sikhanyiso: Hade I left the build on fail, I ran out of data immediately after the commit
[05/06, 09:11] MJ: It wasn’t yours that was failing it was mine
[05/06, 09:11] MJ: You just committed while mine was still failing
[05/06, 09:20] MJ: What’s happing, that happens when you do what?
[05/06, 09:22] MJ: ?
[05/06, 09:23] Emmanuel_: When you want to enter chat
[05/06, 09:24] Emmanuel_: Mode with another user
[05/06, 09:24] MJ: What’s your name
[05/06, 09:24] Emmanuel_: Pinnacle of ***
[05/06, 09:24] MJ: Mine is toasting the right things
[05/06, 09:25] Emmanuel_:  lemme fetch then
[05/06, 09:25] Emmanuel_: That might be the reason
[05/06, 09:25] MJ: Oh ayt
[05/06, 09:31] Sikhanyiso: Ohh
[05/06, 09:32] MJ: I removed your commit files so that I can fix the build, now it’s cool you can commit them
[05/06, 10:33] Sikhanyiso: Ayt
[05/06, 11:28] Donald: Remove settings or put it under settings
[05/06, 11:28] Donald: I think
[05/06, 11:28] MJ: I was thinking if we put calendar on the profile
[05/06, 11:28] MJ: Wait what are those two buttons saying down there I can’t see
[05/06, 11:29] Emmanuel_: It is messages and schedule
[05/06, 11:29] MJ: Is that profile for me as a user or it’s for another user on the platform?
[05/06, 11:30] Emmanuel_: Nop it's yours
[05/06, 11:30] Emmanuel_: It's not for another user
[05/06, 11:32] MJ: Okay okay okay , then Mina I was thinking if we put it in profile, like if I press maybe schedule, it’ll open my calendar and then I’ll add an empty slot
[05/06, 11:35] Emmanuel_: Lemme finish the profile then I'll add interface for you to add that functionality
[05/06, 11:36] Emmanuel_: So messages Should take you to chats ?
[05/06, 11:36] MJ: Ayt cool
[05/06, 11:36] MJ: ya
[05/06, 11:36] Emmanuel_: I was thinking is it wise to list all users at chats
[05/06, 11:37] Emmanuel_: What if there 1500 of them
[05/06, 11:37] MJ: But that’s what happens mos ? Or am I not getting you
[05/06, 11:38] Emmanuel_:  I am saying what if there's 1500 users
[05/06, 11:38] Emmanuel_: Do I have to scroll or we could list users that I have made contact with
[05/06, 11:38] MJ: Eish ya that would be chaotic
[05/06, 11:39] MJ: Oh okay now I get you
[05/06, 11:40] MJ: can we handle that with a Select condition ? (My sql)
[05/06, 11:40] Emmanuel_: So the tricky thing would be making initial contact
[05/06, 11:40] Emmanuel_: I think there might be a way
[05/06, 11:41] MJ: Eish ya 
[05/06, 11:44] Emmanuel_: But so far we have adhered to our client's requirements, right?
[05/06, 11:45] Donald: How about we include search
[05/06, 11:45] MJ: Ya I think so, I guess that’s why apps yae updates 
[05/06, 11:46] Emmanuel_: Yah man we will handle some in next version
[05/06, 11:46] Emmanuel_: Cool we can do that
[05/06, 11:49] Mongezi: I’m trying to catch up I’m lost, what’s wrong?
[05/06, 12:22] MJ: you can start here
[05/06, 13:07] MJ: We should tell rylan we lost a member
[05/06, 13:59] Emmanuel_: I just pushed
[05/06, 13:59] Emmanuel_: Access the profile by clicking settings
[05/06, 13:59] Emmanuel_: I couldn't find a way to fix that
[05/06, 14:06] MJ: yooh  you commited when @Sikhanyisos build was still failing
[05/06, 14:11] Sikhanyiso: Lets wait fr it I was gonna restart the build
[05/06, 14:13] MJ: if it fails just delete the test, its the same problem i mentioned with chatActivity and ViewPosts
[05/06, 14:46] Sikhanyiso: It passes
[05/06, 15:53] Donald: I got them hey
[05/06, 16:41] Donald: at least there is an extension
